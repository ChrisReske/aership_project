def calculate_horsepower( v, p, V, K ):
    """
    Calculates the relation between horsepower speed and size.
    Returns horspower as decimal value.
    The value 550 used in this calculation is the number of
    ft.lbs./sec developed by one Hp.

    Parameters
    -------------

    v : decimal
        Speed in feet feet/seconds

    p : decimal
        Density of the air in slugs/feet ** 3 (1 slug = 32.lbs)

    V : decimal
        air volume of the ship in cubic feet

    K : decimal
        a non-dimensional coefficient depending upon 
        the propeller efficiency and the design of the hull and its appendages.
        `K` is thus a measure of the overall propulsive energy of an airship, 
        including both the resistances of the ship and the propeller efficiency.

    """
    Calculates horsepower taking into account the standard displacement

    Parameters
    -------------
    D (displacement) : decimal
        The weight of a cubic foot of air in the standard atmosphere, i.e.
        temperature 60Â°F , and 29.92 in barometric pressure at sea level
        is 0.07635 lbs

    v (speed) : decimal
        Speed in feet feet/seconds

    p (densitiy_of_air) : decimal
        Density of the air in slugs/feet ** 3 (1 slug = 32.lbs)

    K (design_coefficient): decimal
        a non-dimensional coefficient depending upon 
        the propeller efficiency and the design of the hull and its appendages.
